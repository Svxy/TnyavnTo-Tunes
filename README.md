# Common errors

Here is a list of common errors and how you can fix them.

<br>

### Dependencies aren't up to date

The packages used in this repository get updated often, especially the ytdl-core package. That is why it is always worth a try updating those if you get an error like `invalid URL: undefined` or when the bot crashes when running the play command.

```bash
npm install ytdl-core@latest
```

<br>

### FFmpeg is not installed on the machine running the bot

The `play` command requires FFmpeg to be installed on the machine that is running the bot. You can download it on the official [FFmpeg website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). Note: This isn't relevant if you use the Dockerfile because it will install FFmpeg inside of the container.

# Building The Website

<br>

### TnyavnTo Tunes <a href="https://tnyavnto-tunes.com" target="_blank">Website</a> is hosted on</a> <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Netlify_logo.svg/1920px-Netlify_logo.svg.png?20180815190440" alt="Logo" width="100" height="24"></a>
### If you intend to use my website template for the bot I would recommend redesigning the site before the bot.
### Only rebuild this site if you have atleast 3-6 months of experience doing frontend web development working on HTML/CSS, this site includes no JavaScript.
<br>

> - First, after cloning the repo, open the website folder in your preferred code editor.

> - Second, start with the main page 'index.html', and change the bots information near the header/footer of the page.

> - Third, change the copyright ownership line in the footer to your organization or alias.

> - Fourth, reset the bots statistics as given the fact there arent any custom scripts or api's on this site you need to manually set the bots stats every now and then.

> - Fifth, change the vote buttons at the header to your own bot, or remove the div altogether (class="page-header2").

> - Sixth, make sure to go through the page's head and change titles, descriptions, links, etc, and change invite/redirect links to your own.
<br>

## Building the suggestions page

### The TnyavnTo Tunes <a href="https://tnyavnto-tunes.com" target="_blank">website</a> features a suggestions page, which consists of a form that uses netlifys data attribute in its tag, which allows netlify to detect and recieve data from the form.
<br>

> - First, with that being said, make a netlify account. If you already have one i would recommend reading their documentation on forms if you haven't already.

> - Second, change the bots name and suggestion head description.

> - Third, use 'Building The Website' step three, six, and the second part of step two.

> ### Note: Make sure to clean up CSS when removing divs.
